# Research Track I - first assignment

The assignment requires controlling a holonomic robot in a 2d space with a simple 2d simulator, Stage. 
The simulator can be launched by executing the command:

```
rosrun stage_ros stageros $(rospack find assignment1)/world/exercise.world
```


# My own Implementation


Once I have created a new ROS package, **two ROS nodes** have been developed by using **c++** programming language.
