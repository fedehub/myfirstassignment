In this first assignment we were asked to control an holonomic robot within a 2d space with a simple 2d simulator, Stage. The simulator can be launched by executing the command\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 rosrun stage\_ros stageros $(rospack find assignment1)/world/exercise.world
\end{DoxyCode}


\section*{How the project is structured}

Once I have created a new R\+OS package, {\bfseries two R\+OS nodes} have been developed. For writing the code I have chosen to adopt C++ programming language.

\subsection*{The first node}

The first node, \href{https://github.com/fedehub/myfirstassignment/blob/main/src/random_movement.cpp}{\tt random\+\_\+movement.\+cpp}, implement\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item A R\+OS publisher
\item A R\+OS subscriber
\item A R\+OS client
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsection*{The second node}

The second node \href{https://github.com/fedehub/myfirstassignment/blob/main/src/random_service.cpp}{\tt random\+\_\+service.\+cpp}, implement a server whose aim is to compute 2 random numbers

\subsection*{The rdm.\+srv file}

It is visible in the \href{https://github.com/fedehub/myfirstassignment/blob/main/srv/}{\tt srv} folder and it manages the request/reply of the custom service

\subsection*{Documentation}

The documentation of this project, obtained by means of {\bfseries Doxy\+Gen} is visible, within the \href{https://github.com/fedehub/myfirstassignment/blob/main/docs}{\tt docs} folder

\section*{How to launch}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Firstly, create a folder named \+\_\+\char`\"{}myfirstassignment\char`\"{}\+\_\+
\item Within the aforementioned folder, open the terminal and run 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 git clone https://github.com/fedehub/myfirstassignment/
\end{DoxyCode}

\item Then, to launch the simulation enviroment, please run the comamnd 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 rosrun stage\_ros stageros $(rospack find assignment1)/world/exercise.world
\end{DoxyCode}

\item To launch the \href{https://github.com/fedehub/myfirstassignment/blob/main/src/random_movement.cpp}{\tt firs node}, digit\+:
\end{DoxyEnumerate}


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 rosrun myfirstassignment rand\_ser 
\end{DoxyCode}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item To launch the \href{https://github.com/fedehub/myfirstassignment/blob/main/src/random_service.cpp}{\tt second node}, digit\+:
\end{DoxyEnumerate}


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 rosrun myfirstassignment rand\_mov 
\end{DoxyCode}


So far, the robot should appear in the simulation enviroment and once it reaches a target, it should move toward another direction, looking for the next one.
